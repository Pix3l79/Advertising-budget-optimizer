## Features

- **Optimized Budget Allocation**: Efficiently allocate your advertising budget across multiple channels.
- **Audience Reach Maximization**: Ensure you reach the maximum audience possible within your budget.
- **Real-World Constraints**: Incorporate various constraints such as minimum spend, maximum spend, and channel limits.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize your advertising spend and audience reach for better decision-making.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple interface for both beginners and experienced marketers.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used in this project.
- **CVXPY**: A Python library for convex optimization that helps in modeling the optimization problem.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations of the results.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up your budget allocation:

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np

# Define your budget and constraints
budget = 10000
min_spend = [1000, 2000, 1500]
max_spend = [5000, 7000, 3000]

# Define the optimization variables
spend = cp.Variable(3)

# Define the objective function
objective = cp.Maximize(cp.sum(spend))

# Define the constraints
constraints = [
    cp.sum(spend) <= budget,
    spend >= min_spend,
    spend <= max_spend
]

# Set up the problem
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)

# Solve the problem
problem.solve()

print("Optimal Spend Allocation:", spend.value)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to set up a basic optimization problem using CVXPY. Adjust the `min_spend` and `max_spend` arrays to fit your specific needs.
